# Song Ideas:

Listen to 'I love techno' a bunch of times.
  
## Breakdown:
- chord progression with saw wave beeps on ch 2 and trill on ch 3
- join chords on ch 1 with intervals and slightly more variation
- maybe try to use the theme from the beginning of the song here?
- come in with bass drum and more techno-y hi hat pattern at some point? 
- Maybe save the hi hats for the next techno-y part

## Total structure:
- Come up from chord-y breakdown into more hard techno
- lose the beat a litle
- long build up
- drop into bar 1 again
