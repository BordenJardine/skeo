NOTES
=====

infinite random levels will be hard
if it's too hard,
could do best of 3 with each level only going one map height high
instead of looping

#BUGS ETC
- holding down punch button
- maybe clean up animations if we need room
- better 'stand up' animation
- climb animation sometimes continues after leaving from ladder
- player 1 will always win ties re: punches. Need to add seperate colide phase to fix :(

#SHORT TERM TODO 
- new sound for death

#IF THERE IS ROOM
- effect on death
