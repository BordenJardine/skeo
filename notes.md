NOTES
=====

  Listen to 'I love techno' a bunch of times.
  Build up the drums more slowly
  layer two crazy sequencer lines on top of each other (bass vs lead)
  Still do the up beat trill thing, but make it more interesting

#BUGS ETC
- holding down punch button
- maybe clean up animations if we need room
- better 'stand up' animation
- player 1 will always win ties re: punches. Need to add seperate colide phase to fix :(
- new sound for death

#SHORT TERM TODO 

#IF THERE IS ROOM
- effect on death
- effect on victory
